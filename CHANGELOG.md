## [1.1.0] - 2026-01-24

### New Feature: Pre-Join Authentication

**Authenticate players BEFORE they enter your server!**

Ever wanted players to log in or register before they even see your spawn? Now you can! With the new "Configuration Phase" mode, the login/registration dialog appears during the loading screen - players can't enter your world until they've authenticated.

#### How it works

- **Default mode (off)**: Players join the server first, then see the login dialog (same as before)
- **New mode (on)**: Players see the login dialog while connecting - they can't join until they authenticate

#### Why use it?

- Prevents unauthenticated players from ever seeing your world
- Cleaner experience - no "please login" messages in chat
- Players who fail to authenticate are simply disconnected

#### How to enable

Add these lines to your `config.yml`:

```yaml
dialogs:
  use-configuration-phase: true
  configuration-phase-timeout: 60
```

The timeout is how many seconds a player has to authenticate before being disconnected (default: 60 seconds).
